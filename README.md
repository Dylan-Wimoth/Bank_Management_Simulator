# Bank Management Simulator
Uses object oriented methods to simulate a database/client within a bank. Allows users to create accounts, log in, withdraw/deposit money, change password, etc. A chaining hash table is used to store users in a safe and efficient way. Database can be saved or loaded with a .JSON file. All passwords and SSN are hashed so they cannot be reversed. A tester class is used to teste for edge cases.

# What I learned
- Save and parse JSON in C++
